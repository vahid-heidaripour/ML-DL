# Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step
Here we will be implementing the building blocks of a convolutional neural network!
Here is the steps we needed:
- Convolution functions, including:
    - Zero Padding
    - Convolve window 
    - Convolution forward
    - Convolution backward
- Pooling functions, including:
    - Pooling forward
    - Create mask 
    - Distribute value
    - Pooling backward
